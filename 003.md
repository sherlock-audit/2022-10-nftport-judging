# Stuck Funds and Ownership of NFTCollection.sol can be lost due to Missing checks for address`(0x0)`.

## Summary
Missing checks for zero addresses may lead to problems if the variable addresses are updated incorrectly.
There are plenty of places where there are no address(0) checks.
In that case, it could lead to losing the ownership of the NFT contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `transferOwnership` function can be called by the current admin and later on it calls the internal `_transferOwnership` function which revokes the permission from the current admin and grants the permissions to the new admin which was specified as a function param `newOwner`. 
There is no check in both functions that `newOwner` is not address(0), an admin may mistakenly call this function with a wrong parameter.

## Impact
Calling this function by admin with address(0) param may lead to permanent loss of the contract ownership, all the admin functions will be inaccessible including `withdrawFees`, eventually it leads to loss of funds because the fees will be permanently stuck in the smart contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add address(0) checks before updating an address storage param that was received as a function user input.
