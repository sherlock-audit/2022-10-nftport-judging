# Factory uses signature that do not have expiration

## Summary
NftPort can't remove license from user, once the signature was provided to it, without changing `SIGNER_ROLE` address.

## Vulnerability Detail
In Factory contract there are few [methods](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L186-L225) that are called when signed by trusted signer.

This is how the signature is checked
```solidity
signedOnly(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, instance, data), signature)
```

As you can see there is no any expiration time. That means that once, the signer has signed the signature for the user it can use it for the end of life. It's like lifetime license.
The only option to remove the license from user is to revoke `SIGNER_ROLE` and set it to another account. 
But it's possible that the NFTPort will have a need to do that with current signer.
## Impact
License can't be removed.
