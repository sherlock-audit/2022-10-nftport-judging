# The latestVersion and latestImplementation values could be wrong

## Summary
The latestVersion and latestImplementation values could be wrong

## Vulnerability Detail
Every implementationAddress (See Factory.sol#L351-L356) may supply its own template version. For eg, template ABC has 4 implementations with wrong version orders.

1st address => version 1,
2nd address => version 2,
3rd address => version 4,
4th address =>  version 3

In this code (See Factory.sol#L415-L418), the system will treat

last implementation as 3rd address 
last version as 4

because it has the highest version number which is wrong

## Impact
latestVersion[templateName] and latestImplementation[templateName] could not be the last version and last implementation for a template

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of letting the user to pass in an arbitrary version number, we should have an increment version number for every implementation address of a template
