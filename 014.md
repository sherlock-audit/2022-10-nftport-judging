# Missing Upgrade Implementation Could Resort In Loses

## Summary

The factory has a function for upgrades of the logic. It will never be able to be executed.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`Factory.upgrade`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L114
)

This function is used for upgrades of the factory implementation. It validates that `version` is less than `CODE_VERSION`. 

## Impact

- This contract is upgradable. Since these variables are statically defined the function will never execute. The deployer will be forced to spend Ether on a subsequent deployment to implement upgrades.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function upgrade() external {
    require(version < CODE_VERSION, "Already upgraded");

    /* Start migration code */
    /* End migration code */

    version = CODE_VERSION;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement the upgrade mechanics and have them validated through an audit that the process is sound.
