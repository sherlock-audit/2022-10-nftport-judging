# `abi.encodePacked` Allows Hash Collision

## Summary

From the solidity documentation:
https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/abi-spec.html?highlight=collisions#non-standard-packed-mode
    > If you use `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a, b))` and both `a` and `b` are dynamic types, it is easy to craft collisions in the hash value by moving parts of `a` into `b` and vice-versa. More specifically, `abi.encodePacked("a", "bc") == abi.encodePacked("ab", "c")`.

This issue exists in the Factory contract can results in hash collisions, bypassing the `signedOnly` modifier.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue is in these lines of code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L171
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L195
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L222

As the solidity docs describe, two or more dynamic types are passed to `abi.encodePacked`. Moreover, these dynamic values are user-specified function arguments in external functions, meaning anyone can directly specify the value of these arguments when calling the function. The `signedOnly` modifier is supposed to protect functions to permit only function arguments that have been properly signed to be passed to the function logic, but because a collision can be created, the modifier can be bypassed for certain select inputs that result in the same `encodePacked` value.

## Impact

The `signedOnly` modifier ([line 537](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L537)) is not effective because the modifier can be bypassed by different function arguments that result in the same signature when the values are `encodePacked` together. This can result in the submission of values that were not actually signed.

## Code Snippet

All instances of `abi.encodePacked` in the contract pass multiple dynamic type arguments

## Recommendation

Instead of writing functions to accept several arguments that are hashed inside the function, consider rewriting the function to take the hashed value as a function argument directly so that the hashing process happens off-chain. This approach would solve the issue and save gas.
