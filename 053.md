# GranularRoles.transferOwnership can lead to loss of owner

## Summary
The system currently does not implement a two-step ownership transfer, which can lead to the loss of the owner role.

## Vulnerability Detail
`transferOwnership` directly sets the new owner and does not implement a two-step ownership pattern where the new owner has to accept the ownership.

## Impact
If an invalid address is passed to `transferOwnership`, the owner will be lost (forever). In such a scenario, some of the core functionality of the contracts can become useless because they require elevated roles, which are no longer grantable. In the worst case, this can mean that some NFTs are lost (`reserveMint` no longer callable) or a redeploy is needed, which both leads to a financial loss.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is strongly recommended to use a two-step ownership transfer. See for instance also this medium severity finding by ToB in their Uniswap audit, dealing with the same issue and having the same recommendation: https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/audits/tob/audit.pdf
