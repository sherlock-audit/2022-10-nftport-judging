# Admin can DOS with fees

## Summary
Illogical contract state that leads to DOS: Fees are unbounded

## Vulnerability Detail
The admin can set `deploymentFee` and `callFee` to be extremely high (they are unbounded uint256 values) and cause trouble in future calls, like functions containing the `paidOnly` modifier, as those fees would be impossible to pay

## Impact
Admin can DOS the contract

## Code Snippet
