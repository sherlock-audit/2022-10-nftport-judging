# User can overpay the minting fee / deployee fee / callee fee.

## Summary

User can overpaying the minting fee / deployee fee / callee fee.

## Vulnerability Detail

The user needs to pay deployee fee and callee if they want to use factory contract.

However, the logic below may result in overpaying with no upper bound.

```solidity
modifier paidOnly(uint256 fee) {
    require(msg.value >= fee, "Insufficient payment");
    _;
}
```

because we use msg.value >=, instead of msg.value == fee. User can easily overpay.

Same applies for the minting fee in NFTCollection.sol

the modifier used is

```solidity
/// Check if enough payment was provided
modifier paymentProvided(uint256 payment) {
    require(msg.value >= payment, "Payment too small");
    _;
}
```

>= is used instead of ==

## Impact

Users can overpay the minting fee / deployee fee/callee fee.
