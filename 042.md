# Batch Admin Transfers Inoperable (1155)

## Summary

`transferByOwnerBatch` allows 1155 transfers from selected accounts, protected by a modifier. The docstring states for single transfers that accounts with roles `TRANSFER_ROLE` or `ADMIN_ROLE` may call this function. In the implementation this is not working for accounts with `ADMIN_ROLE`.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`ERC1155NFTProduct.transferByOwnerBatch `](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/templates/ERC1155NFTProduct.sol#L192)

The modifier on this function allows accounts holding specific roles to perform the transfer. Accounts holding `ADMIN_ROLE` may not call this without additionally being granted the `TRANSFER_ROLE`.

## Impact

- Accounts holding `ADMIN_ROLE` will have to pay additional gas to modify the RBAC role to include the admin account

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function transferByOwnerBatch(
    address[] memory to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts
) public onlyRole(TRANSFER_ROLE) {
    require(tokensTransferable, "Transfers are disabled");
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {
        _safeTransferFrom(_owner, to[i], ids[i], amounts[i], "");
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Grant the role in the constructor at deploy time or update the modifer to validate if `msg.sender` holds roles `(TRANSFER_ROLE || ADMIN_ROLE)`
