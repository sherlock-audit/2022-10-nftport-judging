# Calling Template Instance Without Role

## Summary

The administrator of the contracts with the `OPERATOR_ROLE` has two functions that they may use to call a deployed contract instance.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`Factory.call`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L214)

There are two functions named `call` with different signatures. Line 214 has a modifier that validates the caller has signature to validate the caller's address, enabling the `SIGNER_ROLE` check to pass.

[Line 147](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L147) is missing this check and validates the caller is the administrator of the contracts. 

## Impact

- There are multiple access control mechanisms to call the same function. This could enable unauthorised callers to call deployed templates.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function call(address instance, bytes calldata data)
    external
    payable
    operatorOnly(instance)
    paidOnly(callFee)
{
    _call(instance, data, msg.value - callFee);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Present a single external function for users to be able to call deployed templates
- Clarify who should be able to call this function
- Verify that the function has the appropriate access control for the intended authorised callers
