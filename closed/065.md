# No Upper limit or Lower limit for setting new deployment and call fees in factory contract.

## Summary
No Upper limit or Lower limit for setting new deployment and call fees in the factory contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
 An Admin can set a fee as low as 0 and a maximum no limit of maybe 100% or even more. This is not a good way of setting fees, there should exist an upper limit and lower limit and while setting fees there should be a check if the fees are above the lower limit and below the upper limit.

## Impact
the factory contract allows the admin to change the deployment and call fee at any moment and will take effect immediately. Should the admin role is compromised, then an attacker can set an arbitrary value for the fee and possibly steal a huge amount of fees.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an require statement for the upper bound and lower bound for setting fees.
```solidity
uint upperlimit = 50;
uint lowerlimit = 1;
    function setDeploymentFee(uint256 newFee) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) {
        require (newFee > lowerlimit,"fee is too less");
        require (newFee<upperlimit,"fee is too high");
        deploymentFee = newFee;
    }
```
