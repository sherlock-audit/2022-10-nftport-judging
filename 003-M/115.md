# NFTCollection.sol : Lack of validation for runtime configuration when initialize is dangerous.

## Summary
NFTCollection.sol:  during the initializing the contract, `deploymentConfig` and `runtimeConfig` are set.
There is validation for  `deploymentConfig` but not for the `runtimeConfig`. Absence of validation for `runtimeConfig` is not safe.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let say, in one the user error where admin does not set the runtime configuration, before admin is figuring it and fixing, it could have caused the following impact.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/templates/NFTCollection.sol#L164-L190

1. In `function mint(uint256 amount)`, user can mint freely without paying any fee. as the `_runtimeConfig.publicMintPrice` is zero.
2. In `function presaleMint(uint256 amount, bytes32[] calldata proof)` ,minting can happen without any restriction, as the _runtimeConfig.presaleMintPrice is zero.
Infact, all the `runtimeConfig` based function will not work as intended.

user can freely mint without any fee till the `runtimeConfig` is patched.
This kind of issue happens in the past during the upgrade stage. For example in Nomad bridge attack. Missing of one of update cause lose of funds.
