# The upgradeable abstract contract(GranularRoles.sol) should add storage gaps

## Summary
The upgradeable abstract contract(GranularRoles.sol) should add storage gaps
## Vulnerability Detail
For general upgradeable contracts, adding storage gaps may be optional, as new variables can be added at the end of the contract storage.
But for the upgradeable abstract contract(GranularRoles.sol), since it needs to derive new contracts, when it needs to add new storage variables, the new storage variables will override the storage slots in the inheriting contract.
So for the upgradeable abstract contract, adding storage gaps should be necessary.
## Impact
For the upgradeable abstract(GranularRoles.sol), since it needs to derive new contracts, when it needs to add new storage variables, the new storage variables will override the storage slots in the inheriting contract.

Adding storage gaps to the upgradeable abstract contract(GranularRoles.sol)
```
uint256[50] private __gap;
