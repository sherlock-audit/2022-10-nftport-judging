# Replayable signatures allowing free deploys when they should not be free

## Summary
The signatures that are used in `Factory` do not include any replay protection.

## Vulnerability Detail
The calls to `signedOnly` and the modifier itself do not include any replay protection. Because of that, signatures can be used multiple times (in fact forever). This is quite problematic for the following function:
```solidity
    function deploy(
        string calldata templateName,
        bytes calldata initdata,
        bytes calldata signature
    )
```

## Impact
Whenever a new version is released, the user can do a deployment for free, even if the signature was only intended for a much older version. This leads to a loss of fees for the protocol.

## Recommendation
Include a nonce in the signature.
