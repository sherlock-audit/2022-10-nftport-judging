# Setting the wrong Solidity deployment version could introduce vulnerabilities

## Summary
As pragmas are floating in the solution, it's unsure which solidity version will be used before deployment. Some versions, like 0.8.13, introduce bugs that affect the current scope

## Vulnerability Detail
Pragmas are floating in the whole solution at `^0.8.0`.

As Solidity version 0.8.13 is a potential deployment version (not too old, not too new) and it introduces a known medium severity bug which affectes memory writing in assembly (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-blog/blob/499ab8abc19391be7b7b34f88953a067029a5b45/_posts/2022-06-15-inline-assembly-memory-side-effects-bug.md and https://medium.com/certora/overly-optimistic-optimizer-certora-bug-disclosure-2101e3f7994d), choosing such a version would introduce this known medium severity bug in the following contract:

```solidity
evm-minting-master/contracts/lib/Base64.sol:
   2: pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
  55:                 mstore(resultPtr, out)
  62:                 mstore(sub(resultPtr, 2), shl(240, 0x3d3d))
  65:                 mstore(sub(resultPtr, 1), shl(248, 0x3d))
  68:             mstore(result, encodedLen)
```

## Impact
Memory writes in inline assembly blocks can be incorrectly removed under certain conditions.

## Recommendation
Fix the Solidity version to be deployed at `>= 0.8.14`
