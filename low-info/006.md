# Misleading Config.sol COMMENTS

## Summary
Misleading comments in the `Config.sol` library mistakenly claim that the default value for the 
`struct Runtime { bool tokensTransferable; }` is true while it's not.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `tokensTransferable` value is being set in the `initialize` function based on the `runtimeConfig` param that is being sent to the function, by default (if `tokensTransferable`) is not supplied, it will be empty which is false in solidity. Unless the deployer sets it to True, it will be false, which is completely different than what the comments imply.

## Impact
Users might make decisions that are based on their wrong knowledge that by default the `tokensTransferable` param is true.

## Code Snippet
Comments on `Config.sol` implies that `tokensTransferable` is true by default:

In reality, `tokensTransferable` is being set on contract initialization based on the user's input, `ERC721NFTProduct` POC:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the comments in the `Config.sol` file so they represent the reality about the `tokensTransferable` variable.
