# User can deploy and call multiple times with the same signature

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L537-L547

Since there is no `nonce` in the data encoded at the `signedOnly` modifier of `deploy(...)` and `call(...)` function, user can call the function multiple times as much as they wish to deploy new NFT or do a call.

## Vulnerability Detail

A set of functions `deploy(...)` and `call(...)` required a signature of the call payload by a `SIGNER_ROLE` wallet to be used. User has to send the data with a signature to the contract to be validated. It will check that this signature is matched with the data then allowing user to deploy a new NFT or do a call. But because of missing a `nonce` field in the data, user can use the same signature multiple times with the same data payload.

## Impact
User can call the function multiple times with the same signature

## Code Snippet

Function `deploy(...)` check the signature without `nonce` field.
```solidity
function deploy(
    string calldata templateName,
    uint256 templateVersion,
    bytes calldata initdata,
    bytes calldata signature
)
    external
    payable
    signedOnly(
        abi.encodePacked(
            msg.sender,
            templateName,
            templateVersion,
            initdata
        ),
        signature
    )
{
    _deploy(templateName, templateVersion, initdata);
}
```

## Recommendation

Consider adding a `nonce` to prevent signature replay attack.
