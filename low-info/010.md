# If a user accidentally  pays more eth then they had,they will loose those funds

## Summary
* A user can provide more eth then they had to and loss that eth 
## Vulnerability Detail
When a user calls either the contract directly or `call` they can loose funds if they give more then 
`     require(msg.value >= payment, "Payment too small");`
and like most users are going to use the factory contract and in there the owner's function for retrieving funds out of the factory contract is deprecated,which is not good for users who pay more on the fee,nft.
Also this can also happen because if user thinks the price is going up and it dosnt they will just loose funds
## Impact
Loss of funds 
## Code Snippet
```solidity 
//nftCollection.sol
   modifier paymentProvided(uint256 payment) {
        require(msg.value >= payment, "Payment too small");
        _;
    }
//mint() function
        paymentProvided(amount * _runtimeConfig.publicMintPrice)
    {
        require(mintingActive(), "Minting has not started yet");

        _mintTokens(msg.sender, amount);
    }

//factory.sol
    modifier paidOnly(uint256 fee) {
        require(msg.value >= fee, "Insufficient payment");
        _;
    }
```

## Tool used
VIM
## Recommendation
I Would just make the  the payment `==` so users dont loss funds or just add a function for retrieving eth
