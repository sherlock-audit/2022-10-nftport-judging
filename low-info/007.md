# Lack of access control modifier on the upgrade() function

## Summary
- Lack of access control modifier on the `upgrade()` function in the Factory.sol

<br>

## Vulnerability Detail
- There is no access control modifier on the `upgrade()` function in the Factory.sol below.

<br>

## Impact
- If there is no access control modifier on the `upgrade()` function, anyone can call `upgrade()` function. This lead to the upgrade of "version" (CODE_VERSION) by unexpected-external user (caller).

<br>

## Code Snippet
- There is no access control modifier on the `upgrade()` function in the Factory.sol below.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L114-L121
```solidity
    function upgrade() external {
        require(version < CODE_VERSION, "Already upgraded");

        /* Start migration code */
        /* End migration code */

        version = CODE_VERSION;
    }
```

## Tool used
- Manual Review

<br>

## Recommendation
- It should add an access control modifier to `upgrade()` function in order to that only qualified-users can access this function by using access control libraries in @openzeppelin/contracts. (such as onlyOwner, onlyRole, etc)
   - onlyOwner by Ownable.sol：https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/access-control#ownership-and-ownable
   - onlyRole by AccessControl.sol：https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control#role-based-access-control
