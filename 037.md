# Missing ReEntrancy Guard to `mint` function

## Summary
NFTCollection.sol contract has no Re-Entrancy protection in `mint` function


## Vulnerability Detail
if the mint was initiated by a contract, then the contract is checked for its ability to receive ERC721 tokens. Without reentrancy guard, onERC721Received will allow an attacker controlled contract to call the mint again, which may not be desirable to some parties, like allowing minting more than allowed.

## Impact
Although reentrancy attack is considered quite old over the past two years, there have been cases such as:

Uniswap/LendfMe hacks (2020) ($25 mln, attacked by a hacker using a reentrancy)

The BurgerSwap hack (May 2021) ( $7.2 million because of a fake token contract and a reentrancy exploit.)

The SURGEBNB hack (August 2021) ($4 million seems to be a reentrancy-based price manipulation attack.)

CREAM FINANCE hack (August 2021) ($18.8 million, reentrancy vulnerability allowed the exploiter for the second borrow.)

Siren protocol hack (September 2021) ($3.5 million, AMM pools were exploited through reentrancy attack.)

Type of Reentrancy

Details
1 - Single Function Reentrancy
2 - Cross-Function Reentrancy
3 - Cross-Contract Reentrancy

## Code Snippet
The _mintTokens function calls the safemint function

```js
evm-minting-master/contracts/templates/NFTCollection.sol:
  163      /// if `DeploymentConfig.publicMintStart` is before the current block timestamp
  164:     function mint(uint256 amount)
  165:         external
  166:         payable
  167:         paymentProvided(amount * _runtimeConfig.publicMintPrice)
  168:     {
  169:         require(mintingActive(), "Minting has not started yet");
  170: 
  171:         _mintTokens(msg.sender, amount);
  172:     }
  173  

evm-minting-master/contracts/templates/NFTCollection.sol:
  316      /// @dev Internal function for performing token mints
  317:     function _mintTokens(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
  318:         require(amount <= _deploymentConfig.tokensPerMint, "Amount too large");
  319:         require(amount <= availableSupply(), "Not enough tokens left");
  320: 
  321:         _safeMint(to, amount);
  322:     }
  323  


```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use Openzeppelin or Solmate Re-Entrancy pattern

Here is a example of a re-entrancy guard

```js
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract ReEntrancyGuard {
    bool internal locked;

    modifier noReentrant() {
        require(!locked, "No re-entrancy");
        locked = true;
        _;
        locked = false;
    }
}

```
