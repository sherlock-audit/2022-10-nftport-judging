# Burned NFTs can be reminted

## Summary
In the ERC721NFTProduct and ERC1155NFTProduct contracts, a burned NFT  can be reminted.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the ERC721NFTProduct and ERC1155NFTProduct contracts, the tokenID can be specified when minting an NFT, which results in a burned NFT being reminted.
Considering that the tokenID of an NFT is used as a unique identifier in some cases, a burned NFT should not be reminted
## Impact
Reminted NFTs can have the same TokenID as the burned NFTs.
