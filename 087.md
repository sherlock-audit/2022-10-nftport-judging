# `NFTCollection` inherits non-upgradeable contracts

## Summary

`NFTCollection`, an upgradeable contract (judging from the use of `Initialize` function and the design or other templates `ERC721NFTProduct`, `ERC1155NFTProduct`) inherits non-upgradeable version of contracts including `ERC721A`, `ERC2981`, and `AccessControl`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Upgradeable contracts usually put contract initialization code within the `Initialize` function instead of `constructor` since initialization should be done in the context of the proxy contract (delegator). `NFTCollection` uses non-upgradeable version of contracts which do not adopt the `Initialize` function, which might result in states being initialized in incorrect context, and potentially lead to corruption of contract business logic.

## Impact

`NFTCollection` proxy contract will suffer uninitialized states during deploy of contract, and the `NFTCollection` itself will be difficult to upgrade (since inherited parent contracts do not consider upgradeability, and switching to upgradeable implementations in the future will be impossible due to different storage layout).

## Recommendation

Inherit upgradeable version of contracts

```solidity
contract NFTCollection is
    ERC721A-Upgradeable
    ERC2981Upgradeable
    AccessControlUpgradeable
    Initializable
    ITemplate

    …
}

abstract contract ERC2981 is ERC2981Upgradeable {
