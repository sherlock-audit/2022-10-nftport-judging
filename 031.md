# Operators can get signed data once and bypass SDK fees for calls

## Summary

 The signatures used to bypass fees on the `call()` function do not use a nonce or timestamp, so a signed message can be used repeatedly while bypassing fees.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Factory.sol contract has two `call()` functions: one that requires a fee and another that requires a signed message from an address with `SIGNER_ROLE`. 

The signed message simply consists of the msg.sender, instance address, and calldata, so they are replayable.

Here is an example of how an attack could happen:

- An SDK user does not want to pay fees for their calls to their contracts
- They set up an instance of the API wallet using the same private key (generating the same address)
- They submit one transaction through this wallet, and retrieve the signed message from the tx
- They manually use this signed message through the SDK, bypassing fees for all future calls

This process would not be possible for functions that require different arguments, but commonly called functions like `withdrawFees()` and `reserveMint()` are susceptible to replays.

NOTE: There is no information in the contest on how exactly the API wallet and signing process works, so it's possible that this vulnerability is not possible (or is addressable by changing that process). However, this information is not possible to discern from the contracts or documentation provided.

## Impact

Users can bypass fees for common functions, harming the revenue model of the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The simplest option would be to add a timestamp to the signed message that is passed to the call, and validated that it is within some reasonable recent buffer time.

Alternatively, you could track nonces by user to ensure that a fresh message is signed for each transaction.
