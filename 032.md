# Payable deploy functions in Factory keep user funds without forwarding them along

## Summary

Both `deploy()` functions in the Factory.sol contract that don't require a fee are still payable. This is a good decision, as you may implement future contract templates that require funding. However, in the current Factory implementation, any fees sent along with a deployment function are kept by the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

Both `deploy()` functions with signed messages are set to payable. However, if a user is to send funds to these functions, they are not passed along to the deployment and are instead kept in the Factory contract.

This isn't a problem with the current implementation options. If a user sends funds, it is their error, as none of the implementations require funding by the deployer. However, in the future, you may want to release an option (such as a bonding curve with initial tokens minted) that would require initial funding being added to the contract.

Presumably, these use cases are the reason why the `deploy()` function are set to payable. However, in the current implementation, `msg.value` is not passed along to the deployment or the `initialize()` call, and are left in Factory.sol.

## Impact

Users who want to send initial funding to their contracts will end up having their funds irretrievably kept by the protocol.

## Code Snippet

```
function deploy(
        string calldata templateName,
        uint256 templateVersion,
        bytes calldata initdata,
        bytes calldata signature
    )
        external
        payable
        signedOnly(
            abi.encodePacked(
                msg.sender,
                templateName,
                templateVersion,
                initdata
            ),
            signature
        )
    {
        _deploy(templateName, templateVersion, initdata);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Pass along the `msg.value` to the `_deploy()` function, and then to the `_call()` function so that payment is included in the `initialize()` function.

Similarly, the `deploy()` function for users who are paying fees should pass along `msg.value - deploymentFee`.
