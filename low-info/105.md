# Eth sent more than the required fees will remain in contract.

## Summary
Surplus Eth sent in msg.value in the Factory contract remains in the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The Factory contract has fees to call the `deploy()` and `call()` functions. paidOnly() modifier checks whether the msg.value is GT or ET to the fee. 
However, if the msg.value > fee, the surplus Eth is not returned to the caller and it remains in the contract. Finally, the admin can call `withdrawFees()` function and drains the balance of the contract to an EOA. Even if the intention is to manually go through the surplus fees and sending back to the users, this does not comply with the urgent needs of the user. Even if it's returned back by the admin after some time, the user will have the disadvantage of it if in a bear market condition like we're in now.
## Impact
Loss of funds
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function deploy(string calldata name, bytes calldata initdata)
        external
        payable
        paidOnly(deploymentFee)
    {
        _deploy(name, latestVersion[name], initdata);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider changing the modifier as;
```solidity
    modifier paidOnly(uint256 fee) {
        require(msg.value = fee, "Insufficient/over payment");
        _;
    }
```
