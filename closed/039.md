# Admin Role Not Initialised At Deployment

## Summary

There is a role for `_owner ` and `_nftPort ` which is granted to `msg.sender`. This function is not called at deploy time and therefore will not establish these roles correctly.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`GranularRoles._initRoles`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/lib/GranularRoles.sol#L103)

This function is used to assign `ADMIN_ROLE` to `_owner ` and `_nftPort`. This is an internal function and may only be called from inside the contract. There is no call to this contract and it is not possible to call after deployment. Therefore this function is unable to be called and the desired roles will not be established.

## Impact

- Missing RBAC roles for `_owner ` and `_nftPort` and unable to set these post deployment

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _initRoles(address owner_, RolesAddresses[] memory rolesAddresses)
    internal
 {
    _owner = owner_;
    _nftPort = msg.sender;
    _grantRole(ADMIN_ROLE, _owner);
    _grantRole(ADMIN_ROLE, _nftPort);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Use a constructor and setup these roles at deploy time via `_setupRole`
