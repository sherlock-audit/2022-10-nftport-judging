# EIP-2981 royalties can be > `salePrice`

## Summary
The ERC2981 implementation of `royaltyInfo` can result in a royalty that is more than 100% of the sale price

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently in both `ERC1155NFTProduct` and `ERC721NFTProduct` the `royaltiesBasisPoints` storage variable can be updated by an address with the `UPDATE_CONTRACT_ROLE` role anytime. This storage variable is used in the ERC2981 `royaltyInfo()` method with the formula 
`(royaltiesBasisPoints * salePrice) / ROYALTIES_BASIS`.
The problem is if after an update `royaltiesBasisPoints` is more than `ROYALTIES_BASIS` then the royalty will actually be a bigger amount than the `salePrice`, which should never happen.

## Impact
This will result in a miscalculated royalty and the consumer of this data can mistakenly send a bigger amount than it should had, resulting in a loss

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the `update()` method in both `ERC1155NFTProduct` and `ERC721NFTProduct` add a check like the following:
`require(newConfig.royaltiesBps <= ROYALTIES_BASIS, "Royalties can't be more than 100%");`
