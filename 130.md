# Deployment fee is never paid

## Summary

The`deploymentFee` value is never subtracted from `msg.value`. To compare, the `callFee` [is subtracted from msg.value on line 153](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L153).

## Vulnerability Detail

The state variable `deploymentFee` is described as `Deployment fee, used for deploying clones without a signature`. But this value is not used properly. For one, it is not subtracted from `msg.value`. Secondly, the modifier `paidOnly(deploymentFee)` is found on [the first `deploy` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L133) but it is absent from [the second `deploy` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L163). Even if the first `deploy` function did subtract the `deploymentFee` from msg.value, this payment requirement could be bypassed using the second `deploy` function.

## Impact

Protocol does not collect intended fees because `deploymentFee` is not captured from msg.value.

## Code Snippet

The state variable `deploymentFee` is not used properly
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L65-L66

The `paidOnly` modifier only appears as a check on the first deploy function, not on the second

## Recommendation

[Line 129 says](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L129) `Requires deploymentFee to be paid by the caller. Deprecated and will be removed.` but it has not been removed from the code yet. The code does not look ready for production yet and needs edits before final deployment.
