# Presale minting can't have a different whitelisted amount for different people

## Summary
Presale minting can't have a different whitelisted amount for different people

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/templates/NFTCollection.sol#L176-L190

Only up to tokensPerMint token can be minted in presale. And it is the same across all whitelisted users.

## Impact
Most projects that can be minted more than 1 usually have a different whitelisted amount for different people but it doesn't support it.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
 function presaleMint(uint256 amount, bytes32[] calldata proof) 
     external 
     payable 
     paymentProvided(amount * _runtimeConfig.presaleMintPrice) 
 { 
     require(presaleActive(), "Presale has not started yet"); 
     require( 
         isWhitelisted(msg.sender, proof), 
         "Not whitelisted for presale" 
     ); 

     _presaleMinted[msg.sender] += amount; 

     // Limit mintable amount
     require(_presaleMinted[msg.sender] <= presaleMintable[msg.sender], "Overmint");

     _mintTokens(msg.sender, amount); 
 } 
```
