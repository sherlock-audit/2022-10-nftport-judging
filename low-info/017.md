# Using `bool`s for storage incurs overhead

## Summary

Using bools for storage incurs overhead

## Vulnerability Detail

Booleans are more expensive than `uint256` or any type that takes up a full word because each write operation emits an extra `SLOAD` to first read the slot's contents, replace the bits taken up by the boolean, and then write back. This is the compiler's defense against contract upgrades and pointer aliasing, and it cannot be disabled.

## Impact

Changing from 'false' to 'true', after having been 'true' in the past costs 20000 gas

## Code Snippet

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L63

```js
File: contracts/Factory.sol

63:    mapping(address => bool) public whitelisted;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `uint256(1)` and `uint256(2)` for true/false to avoid a `Gwarmaccess (100 gas)`, and to avoid `Gsset (20000 gas)` when changing from `false` to `true`, after having been `true` in the past.
