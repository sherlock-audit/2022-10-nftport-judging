# The supply of NFT for each tokenID in ERC1155NFTProduct cannot be modified after the first minting

## Summary
The supply of NFT for each tokenID in ERC1155NFTProduct cannot be modified after the first minting
## Vulnerability Detail
When minting NFT in the ERC1155NFTProduct contract, it will check whether the tokenID already exists, that is, as long as tokenSupply[tokenId] > 0, the ERC1155 NFT of this tokenId will not be able to be minted again.
This will lead to
1. The supply of NFT for each tokenID is determined after the first mint
2. Unable to mint ERC1155 NFT with the same tokenId for different users

This will greatly limit the application scenarios of ERC1155NFTProduct
## Impact

1. The supply of NFT for each tokenID is determined after the first mint
2. Unable to mint ERC1155 NFT with the same tokenId for different users
