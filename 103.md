# [NAZ-M2] `ADMIN_ROLE` Can Be Granted By The Deployer and Can Lose Collected Fees

## Summary
`withdrawFees()` is meant to be used by the holders of the `ADMIN_ROLE` to withdraw the fees collected by the factory.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the holders of the `ADMIN_ROLE` where to call `withdrawFees()` with the wrong `to` address they would be lost forever.

## Impact
Holders of the `ADMIN_ROLE` can lose all fees collected accidentally. 

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a state value that holds the fee receiver address and set it inside the `initialize()` function while adding a way to update it.
