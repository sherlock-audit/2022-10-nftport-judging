# Missing Events for critical functions

## Summary
Functions that change critical contract parameters/addresses/state should emit events so that users and other privileged roles can detect upcoming changes (by off-chain monitoring of events) and have the time to react to them.

## Vulnerability Detail
A lot of critical and sensitive functions (admin functions mostly) allow updating important storage variables and configuration of the NFTs and Factory contracts. No events are emitted while those storage variables are updated.

## Impact
Critical parameters could be changed without users noticing and having time to react, which may lead to users loosing their assets.

## Code Snippet
The `ERC1155NFTProduct.update()` is updating the `baseURI`, `royaltiesAddress`, `royaltiesBasisPoints`, `tokensTransferable`, `metadataUpdatable` without emitting events:

The `ERC721NFTProduct.update()` is updating the `baseURI`, `royaltiesAddress`, `royaltiesBasisPoints`, `tokensTransferable`, `metadataUpdatable` without emitting events:

The `GranularRoles. _initRoles()` and `GranularRoles. _updateRoles()` sets and update roles (including admins) without emitting any events:

The `deploymentFee` in the `Factory` contract is being updated without emitting events:

The `callFee` in the `Factory` contract is being updated without emitting events:

Tokens are minted in `NFTCollection.sol` without emitting any events:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/templates/NFTCollection.sol#L317-L322

`_runtimeConfig` is being updated in `NFTCollection.sol` without emitting any events:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/templates/NFTCollection.sol#L289-L295

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Emit events in those critical admin functions to inform the users.
