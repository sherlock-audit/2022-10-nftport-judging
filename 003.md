# Stuck Funds and Ownership of NFTCollection.sol can be lost due to Missing checks for address`(0x0)`.

## Summary
Missing checks for zero addresses may lead to problems if the variable addresses are updated incorrectly. There are plenty of places with 0 address checks. In that case, it could lead to losing the ownership of the NFT contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `transferOwnership` function can be called by the current admin, and later on it calls the internal `_transferOwnership` function which revokes the permission from the current admin and grants the permissions to the new admin which was specified as a function param `newOwner`. 

There is no check in either function that `newOwner` is not address(0) - an admin may mistakenly call this function with a wrong parameter.

## Impact
Calling this function by admin with address(0) param may lead to permanent loss of the contract ownership, and all the admin functions will be inaccessible including `withdrawFees`. Eventually, it leads to loss of funds because the fees will be permanently stuck in the smart contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add address(0) checks before updating an address storage param that was received as a function user input.
