# Owner can reserve a large amount of NFT to make the NFT distribution centralized in NFTCollection.sol

## Summary

The owner can reserve a large amount of NFT to make the NFT distribute centralized.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current deployment setting for NFTCollections.sol

```javascript
const deploymentDefaults = {
  name: "NFTCollection",
  symbol: "NFT",
  maxSupply: 1000,
  tokensPerMint: 10,
  treasuryAddress: "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045",
  reservedSupply: 0,
};
```

we can change the max supply to 100 and the reserved supply to 99.

The owner can resolve a large amount of reserved NFT. They can rug user after using mint the NFT and push the floor price,
then the owner can mint a large amount of reserved NFT and dump on user.

If the project use NFT for on-chain governance, the governance can also become very centralized because of the large reserved NFT amount.

## Impact

NFT distribution is centralized.
