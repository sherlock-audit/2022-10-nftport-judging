# _validateDeploymentConfig function in NFTCollection.sol doesn't check all conditions

## Summary

Due to not thoroughly checking all conditions of the deployment config, users might not be able to mint certain amount of tokens. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In `NFTCollection.sol`, there is a function called [_validateDeploymentConfig](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/templates/NFTCollection.sol#L325-L340), which checks whether the `deploymentConfig` input to [initialize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/templates/NFTCollection.sol#L145) function is valid. 

The function checks whether the `maxSupply` and `tokensPerMint` are greater than zero. But it never checks if the `tokensPerMint` is less than or equal to `maxSupply`. 

Suppose `maxSupply` < `tokensPerMint`. Then if the user calls a function which in-turn calls the  [_mintTokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/templates/NFTCollection.sol#L317) function with an `amount` equal to `tokensPerMint`, it will revert. Even though he is technically trying to mint as per the `rules`. This is because the `availableSupply()` won't be greater than `amount`. 


## Impact

1. Dissatisfaction and Frustration of the user along with loss of his gas fees. 
2. The contract would need redeployment as deployment config cannot be changed once its set.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function _mintTokens(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        require(amount <= _deploymentConfig.tokensPerMint, "Amount too large");
        require(amount <= availableSupply(), "Not enough tokens left");

        _safeMint(to, amount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review, VSCode

## Recommendation

Add a require statement in the `_validateDeploymentConfig` function:
```solidity
require(config.tokensPerMint <= config.maxSupply, "Tokens per mint must be lte Maximum supply");
```
