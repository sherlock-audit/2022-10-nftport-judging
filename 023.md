# Unauthorized Template Operator Status Changes

## Summary

The operator status of the template instance may be changed by a third party.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`Factory.setOperator`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L233)

`setOperator` allows updates to the role `OPERATOR_ROLE ` via `_grantRole`. There is validation in this function to ensure that the caller is not the same as the `owner` argument. There is no validation that the caller setting the `OPERATOR_ROLE` should be permitted to do so.

## Impact

- Third parties may update RBAC roles which revokes the operator role from the deployed template

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _setOperator(
    address instance,
    address operator,
    bool allowed
) internal {
    if (allowed) {
        _grantRole(OPERATOR_ROLE(instance), operator);
    } else {
        _revokeRole(OPERATOR_ROLE(instance), operator);
   }

    emit OperatorChanged(instance, operator, allowed);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Validate that the caller is the owner of the instance that is having the `OPERATOR_ROLE` modified
