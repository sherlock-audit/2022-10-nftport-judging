# Lack of validation check for runtimeConfig durnng initialization in ERC721NFTProduct and ERC1155NFTProduct contracts.

## Summary
Lack of validation check for `runtimeConfig` during initialization in ERC721NFTProduct and ERC1155NFTProduct contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-
master/contracts/templates/ERC1155NFTProduct.sol#L88-L106

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/templates/ERC721NFTProduct.sol#L82-L100

Since the critical parameters like royaltiesAddress, royaltiesBps, metadataUpdatable, tokensBurnable, tokensTransferable are updated, missing any one of them could cause irreversible damage in short span of time.
Recent hacks due this kind of user error can be remembered.

## Impact
When any one of the critical parameters `royaltiesAddress, royaltiesBps, metadataUpdatable, tokensBurnable, tokensTransferable`are missed to update. this could cause irreversible damage in short span of time till it is patched by the admin.
The operations depends on these parameters could be affected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
