# Factory.sol : Issue with arbitrary data as signature in signature based call and deploy methods.

## Summary
In Factory contract, deploy and call methods are using the signature based approach for deployment. This is not safe when we look at the way the signature is comes from user.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L147-L225

In above line of codes, user is allowed for deployment by using the signature data. This could have multiple impacts as explained in Impact section.

## Impact
1. Signature replay attack.
2. Signature reuse across different NFT Port projects if it is to be launched in multiple chains.
Because the chain ID is not included in the data, all signatures are also valid when the project is launched on a chain with another chain ID. For instance, let’s say it is also launched on Polygon. An attacker can now use all of the Ethereum signatures there. Because the Polygon addresses of user’s (and potentially contracts, when the nonces for creating are the same) are often identical, there can be situations where the payload is meaningful on both chains.
3. Signature without domain , nonces are not safe along with the standard specified in EIP 712. 
4. Signature reuse from different Ethereum projects & phishing
Because the  signature is very generic, there might be situations where a user has already signed data with the same format for a completely different Ethereum application. Furthermore, an attacker could set up a DApp that uses the same format and trick someone into signing the data. Even a very security-conscious owner that has audited the contract of this DApp (that does not have any vulnerabilities and is not malicious, it simply consumes signatures that happen to have the same format) might be willing to sign data for this DApp, as he does not anticipate that this puts his NFT Port project in danger.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I strongly recommend to follow [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) and not implement your own standard / solution. While this also improves the user experience, this topic is very complex and not easy to get right, so it is recommended to use a battle-tested approach that people have thought in detail about. All of the mentioned attacks are not possible with EIP-712:
1.) There is always a domain separator that includes the contract address.
2.) The chain ID is included in the domain separator
5.) There is a type hash (of the function name / parameters)
6.) The domain separator does not allow reuse across different projects, phishing with an innocent DApp is no longer possible (it would be shown to the user that he is signing data for Rigor, which he would off course not do on a different site)
