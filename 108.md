# [NAZ-M3] Value Range Validity for Fee Setters

## Summary
These functions doesn't have any checks to ensure that the variables being set is within some kind of value range. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Fees can be set to high numbers by the owner to steal funds from users. Especially since excess `msg.value` can be sent with these functions an owner can front-run those users and they wouldn't even notice.

## Impact
Contract owners can front-run users and increase fees.

## Code Snippet
[`Factory.sol#L310`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L310), [`Factory.sol#L319`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L319)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Each variable input parameter updated should have it's own value range checks to ensure their validity and prevent malicious owner from stealing from users.
