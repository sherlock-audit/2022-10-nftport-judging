# Nonces not used in signed data

## Summary
Nonces not used in signed data
## Vulnerability Detail
A nonce can prevent an old value from being used when a new value exists. Without one, two transactions submitted in one order, can appear in a block in a different order

```solidity
    function deploy(
        string calldata templateName,
        uint256 templateVersion,
        bytes calldata initdata,
        bytes calldata signature
    )
        external
        payable
        signedOnly(
            abi.encodePacked(
                msg.sender,
                templateName,
                templateVersion,
                initdata
            ),
            signature
        )
    {
        _deploy(templateName, templateVersion, initdata);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Include a nonce in what is signed
