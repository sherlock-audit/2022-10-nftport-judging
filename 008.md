# Missing storage slot gap could leads to unexpected behavior when perform contract upgrading.

## Summary

Missing storage slot gap could leads to unexpected behavior when perform contract upgrading.

## Vulnerability Detail

`GranularRoles` is an abstract base **upgradbleble** contract derived by `ERC721NFTProduct` and `ERC1155NFTProduct` . Â `GranularRoles` may add new features by adding additional storage variables someday, but there is no remaining storage slot gap for this purpose. If blindly add a new storage variable in `GranularRoles` contract, both `ERC721NFTProduct` and `ERC1155NFTProduct` storage layouts will be overwritten, which may lead to unexpected behavior. Please refer [openzeppelin doc](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#storage-gaps)

## Impact

contract storage slot may be overwitten, which leads to unexpeted behovior.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add storage slot gap.

```solidity

abstract contract GranularRoles is AccessControlUpgradeable {
     ......
    // Contract owner address, this address can edit the contract on OpenSea and has `ADMIN_ROLE`
    address internal _owner;
    // Initialized as the address that initializes the contract.
    address internal _nftPort;

    // Used to get roles enumeration
    mapping(bytes32 => address[]) internal _rolesAddressesIndexed;
    // Mapping from role to boolean that shows if role can be updated
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) internal _rolesFrozen;
   // add storag gap here
   uint256[48] __gap;
    ......
}

```
