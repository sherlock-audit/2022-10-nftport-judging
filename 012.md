# block.timestmap will be overflow  in 2106 and by then the contracts will be dosed and can cause loss of funds

## Summary
*  block.timestmap will be overflow  in 2106 and by then the contracts will be dosed  and can cause loss of funds
## Vulnerability Detail
 block.timestmap will be overflow  in 2106 and by then the contracts will be dosed because of overflow   and it  can cause loss of funds 
even if there wasn't a revert of overflow and it just unchecked it,the contract wont be able to mint anything because of `block.timestmap <publicMintStart` when `block.timstamp=0` 
## Impact
dos and not able to buy nfts  from the contracts before `block.timestamp` oveflowed
## Code Snippet
```
   function mintingActive() public view returns (bool) {
        // We need to rely on block.timestamp since it's
        // easier to configure across different chains
        // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
        return block.timestamp > _runtimeConfig.publicMintStart;
    }

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make uncheked block.timestamp and have a function to update `publicMintStart`
