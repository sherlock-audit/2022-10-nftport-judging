# Wrong check on `mintingActive()` and `presaleActive()` prevents the mint of tokens in the same block

## Summary
Because `mintingActive() and `presaleActive()` uses a strict inequality, a minting that is called in the same block after the public mint or presale mint has been initiated is not possible, which I believe is not intentional.

## Vulnerability Detail
`block.timestamp > _runtimeConfig.publicMintStart` and `block.timestamp > _runtimeConfig.presaleMintStart` prevents mint from being called if mints are done in the same block after the public mint / presale mint initiation since they share the same `block.timestamp`.

## Impact
Users will not be able to mint in the same block as the transaction that initiates and set the `runtimeConfig` values.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `block.timestamp >= _runtimeConfig.publicMintStart` and `block.timestamp >= _runtimeConfig.presaleMintStart` instead.
