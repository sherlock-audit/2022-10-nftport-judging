# Minting times are not checked when RuntimeConfigs are updated

## Summary

When a creator calls the `updateConfig()` function to update their contract variables, the timing for the presale mint and public mint are not validated. This allows creators to change these values in expected and harmful ways.

## Vulnerability Detail

When `updateConfig()` is called by a creator, it calls out to `_validateRuntimeConfig()` to ensure the new variables are acceptable. 

This function checks that frozen prices or metadata are not changed, however, it does not perform any checks on the minting start times.

As a result, a creator can move a project in an out of the different minting phases at will. For example, they may see that there is additional demand during the presale phase and decide to prematurely switch into the public mint phase. Or, even worse, in the middle of the public mint, they could revert back to presale, or close the sale entirely. In a worst case scenario, creators could frontrun a specific user's minting transaction to close and then reopen minting to avoid them being able to mint.

## Impact

Users will not have certainty that minting for any projects will flow in the way the project committed to, either through shifting up the timelines, by jumping back and forth between phases in unexpected ways, or by blocking mints from specific users.

This is fine in most cases, but the problem I see is that there is no way for creators to "freeze" this ability to ensure that their users know this won't happen.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a validation to the `_validateRuntimeConfig()` function to ensure that creators cannot change the values of a minting phase that is currently active, and therefore cannot move backwards through minting phases:

```
if (block.timestamp > _runtimeConfig.publicMintStart) {
    require(config.publicMintStart == _runtimeConfig.publicMintStart);
} 
if (block.timestamp > _runtimeConfig.presaleMintStart) {
    require(config.presaleMintStart == _runtimeConfig.presaleMintStart);
}
```
