# _validateRuntimeConfig checks are being bypassed in the NFTCollection.sol contract initialization

## Summary
The internal `_validateRuntimeConfig` function is validating that the `RuntimeConfig` parameters that were supplied are correct (Royalties are not too high, mint price and metadata are correct, etc..).
In case the admin is calling the `updateConfig` external function, the internal validation function is being executed to make sure that the supplied parameters are correct.
But, somehow it seems like the developers forgot to validate the runtime config params on the `initialize` function. We can see that only the `deploymentConfig` params are being validated using the `_validateDeploymentConfig` function but there is no validation for the `runtimeConfig` parameters before setting them to the `_runtimeConfig` storage variable. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Validation are not executed for `runtimeConfig` on contract initialization, but only in the `updateConfig` function.

## Impact
Users can bypass the `_validateRuntimeConfig` internal function checks on initialisation which can lead to creation of NFT collections with royalties of more than 100%, unfreeze presale and public mint price, and allow base URI to change.

## Code Snippet
No call for `_validateRuntimeConfig` in the `initialize` function:

Call for `_validateRuntimeConfig` in the `updateConfig ` function:

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Execute `_validateRuntimeConfig(runtimeConfig);` before executing the line `_runtimeConfig = runtimeConfig;` in the `initialize` function.
