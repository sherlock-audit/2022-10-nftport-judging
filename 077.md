# Admin Cannot Batch Mint (1155)

## Summary

`mintByOwnerBatch` allows 1155 to be minted from selected accounts, protected by a modifier. The docstring states that accounts with roles `MINT_ROLE` or `ADMIN_ROLE` may call this function. In the implementation this is not working for accounts with `ADMIN_ROLE`.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`ERC1155NFTProduct.mintByOwnerBatch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/templates/ERC1155NFTProduct.sol#L279)

The modifier on this function allows accounts holding specific roles to perform the mint. Accounts holding `ADMIN_ROLE` may not call this without additionally being granted the `MINT_ROLE`.

## Impact

- Accounts holding `ADMIN_ROLE` will have to pay additional gas to modify the RBAC role to include the admin account

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function mintByOwnerBatch(
    address[] memory to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    string[] memory uris
) public onlyRole(MINT_ROLE) {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {
        require(!_exists(ids[i]), "One of tokens is already minted");
        require(
            to[i] == address(to[i]),
            "NFT: one of addresses is invalid"
        );
        require(amounts[i] > 0, "NFT: all amounts must be > 0");
        tokenSupply[ids[i]] += amounts[i];
        if (bytes(uris[i]).length > 0) {
            _tokenURIs[ids[i]] = uris[i];
            emit URI(uris[i], ids[i]);
        }
        _mint(to[i], ids[i], amounts[i], "");
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Grant the role in the constructor at deploy time or update the modifier to validate if `msg.sender` holds roles `(MINT_ROLE || ADMIN_ROLE)`
