# Possible token Total Supply mismatch in ERC1155NFTProduct

## Summary
Due to a check-effect-interact pattern issue, it is possible for the token total supply to not match the number of tokens in circulation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ERC1155NFTProduct.mintByOwner calls the `_mint()` function before incrementing `tokenSupply[id]` , in the event of a re-entrancy attack by the MINT_ROLE, the amount of tokens minted would not match the value in tokenSupply[id]. The re-entry to the function from _mint() call would pass the require check in `require(!_exists(id), "NFT: token already minted");` since the value for _exists(id) would be false.

## Impact
Token supply mismatch
