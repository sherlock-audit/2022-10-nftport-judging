# Malicious Operator can revoke Operator for all other known operators

## Summary
It is possible for a malicious operator to revoke the operator role of others.

## Vulnerability Detail
The call to Factory.setOperator() allows any operator to revoke the operator role of others. An operator with malicious intent may revoke the OPERATOR_ROLE for all other operators and them perform malicious activities on the deployed contract templates. 

Whilst it is ideal to have the functions to set and unset operators, the `setOperator()` function logic allows for abuse.

## Impact
Possible rug pull by a malicious operator.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function setOperator(
        address instance,
        address operator,
        bool allowed
    ) external operatorOnly(instance) {
        require(msg.sender != operator, "Cannot change own role");

        _setOperator(instance, operator, allowed);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Include contract owner (possibly admin too) in the operatorOnly modifier to be able to call the function in an event of the function abuse.
