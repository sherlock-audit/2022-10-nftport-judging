# Deployer can set royalties to greater than 100%

## Summary

In the `NFTCollection.sol` implementation, the initial deployer can set `royaltiesBps` to a number greater than 10,000. In the best case, this will cause all sales on marketplaces that support EIP-2981 to revert. In a worst case, it may cause a downstream bug in a marketplace.

## Vulnerability Detail

When RuntimeConfig is updated using the `updateConfig()` function, `_validateRuntimeConfig()` is called, which performs the following check:

`require(config.royaltiesBps <= ROYALTIES_BASIS, "Royalties too high");`

However, when the contract is initially deployed, there is no such check on the `royaltiesBps` value.

A creator could therefore deploy a new collection with a `royaltiesBps` value greater than 10,000, which could cause a number of possible complications down the road.

## Impact

In the best (and expected) situation, marketplaces should have a check that the royalty amount is less than the sale amount, and will revert in this case. As a result, all sales of this collection will fail.

In a worst case, it may cause a downstream bug in a marketplace that didn't account for this bug in their logic.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the following require statement to the `initialize()` function:

`require(config.royaltiesBps <= ROYALTIES_BASIS, "Royalties too high");`
