# Use `unchecked()` for loop iterator for gas optimisation

## Summary

Use `unchecked()` for loop iterator to optimise gas usage

## Vulnerability Details

In line `255` & in `273` of `Factory.sol` there is scope for gas optimisation. From solidity `0.8.0` the checks for underflow and overflow are done by default. The default "checked" behavior costs more gas when calculating, because under-the-hood those checks are implemented as a series of opcodes that, prior to performing the actual arithmetic, check for under/overflow and revert if it is detected. So When doing math operations from 0.8.0 or greater, and you can prove that there is no possible way for your arithmetic to under/overflow. And also for contracts compiled using version `0.8.0` and above, because now the compiler implements what SafeMath does there's no need to use that either.

## Impact

Costs more gas for under/over flow checks

## Code Snippet

```js
for (uint256 i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    templateNames[i] = _templateNames[i];
}
```

```js
for (uint256 i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    templateVersions[i] = _templateVersions[templateName][i];
}

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

For gas optimisation we can rewrite this part like this:

- `L255-L257`

```js
for (uint256 i = 0; i < count;) {
    templateVersions[i] = templateNames[templateName][i];
    unchecked {
        ++i;
    }
}
```

- `L273-L275`

```js
for (uint256 i = 0; i < count;) {
    templateVersions[i] = _templateVersions[templateName][i];
    unchecked {
        ++i;
    }
}
```

- `++i` consumes less gas than `i++`.

- `N.B.` If you're using `i++` then you should check for under/over flow condition.
