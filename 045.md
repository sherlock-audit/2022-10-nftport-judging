# Factory and NFTCollection doesn't return change to the sender

## Summary
Both `Factory` and `NFTCollection` doesn't return change to the sender.
## Vulnerability Detail
`Factory` use `paidOnly` [modifier](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L552-L555) and `NFTCollection` contract uses `paymentProvided` [modifier](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/templates/NFTCollection.sol#L514-L517) to calculate that user has sent enough money. 
But in both cases if user overpays, nothing is sent back to him.
## Impact
User lose overpaid funds.
## Code Snippet
```solidity 
    modifier paymentProvided(uint256 payment) {
        require(msg.value >= payment, "Payment too small");
        _;
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Take only fee in case of `Factory` or tokens price amount in case of `NFTCollection` and return change.
