# Re-entrancy issue in ERC721NFTProduct mintToCaller function

## Summary
The mintToCaller function is vulnerable to re-entrancy attack due to the function making a call to ERC721Upgradeable._safeMint()

## Vulnerability Detail
When the user or contract with the `MINT_ROLE` calls ERC721NFTProduct.mintToCaller() , they are able to re-enter the function due to the call back in `_checkOnERC721Received` in  the call to ERC721Upgradeable._safeMint(). This would allow the Minter to re-enter mintToCaller multiple times. Although token URI will not be set for most minted tokens in the re-entrancy attack, except for the last minted token, the token URIs can still be set by the `UPDATE_TOKEN_ROLE`

## Impact
This may lead to minting out a token by a user and possible a loss of funds in a corresponding context.

## Code Snippet
mintToCaller function with no re-entrancy protecton
```solidity
function mintToCaller(
        address caller,
        uint256 tokenId,
        string memory tokenURI
    ) public onlyRole(MINT_ROLE) returns (uint256) {
        _safeMint(caller, tokenId);
        _setTokenURI(tokenId, tokenURI);
        return tokenId;
    }
```



## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Implement necessary check-effect-interact patterns
2. Apply necessary non-reentrancy guards and mutexes.
