# In `ERC721NFTProduct.sol` and `ERC1155NFTProduct.sol` the runtime Config parameters are not checked for validity

## Summary

Due to not thoroughly checking all conditions of the runtime config, the contract might become useless and NFT's might be permanently lost.

## Vulnerability Detail

The mistakes are very similar in both contracts. So I will explain it with the `ERC721NFTProduct` contract first.

In `ERC721NFTProduct.sol`, there is a function called [update](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/templates/ERC721NFTProduct.sol#L186), which updates the runtime configuration parameters. Here the new values are directly assigned instead of first checking their validity.

The following conditions are not checked:
1. `royaltiesAddress` is not checked to be not equal to Zero-Address.
2. `royaltiesBasisPoints` is not checked to be less than or equal to `ROYALTIES_BASIS`. If this condition is not satisfied, many function will revert, making the protocol useless.

One might argue that the above settings could be changed later by calling `update` function again. But that is possible only if the `metadataUpdatable` is `true`. 

The same conditions should be checked within the [initialize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/templates/ERC721NFTProduct.sol#L82) function as well.

Its important to note that, doing the wrong settings for a long-running contract can literally cripple the contract and bring enormous loss to users.

The same error exists in the [update](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/templates/ERC1155NFTProduct.sol#L223) function in `ERC1155NFTProduct.sol` file as well.

## Impact

1. Dissatisfaction and Frustration of the user along with loss of his gas fees. 
2. The contract would need redeployment as runtime config cannot be changed if `metadataUpdatable` is set to be `false`. 
3. Worst case scenario, all nft's get locked in the contract without being able to transfer them.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function update(
        Config.Runtime calldata newConfig,
        RolesAddresses[] memory rolesAddresses,
        bool isRevokeNFTPortPermissions
    ) public onlyRole(UPDATE_CONTRACT_ROLE) {
        // If metadata is frozen, baseURI cannot be updated
        require(
            metadataUpdatable ||
                (keccak256(abi.encodePacked(newConfig.baseURI)) ==
                    keccak256(abi.encodePacked(baseURI))),
            "Update: Metadata is frozen"
        );

        baseURI = newConfig.baseURI;
        royaltiesAddress = newConfig.royaltiesAddress;
        royaltiesBasisPoints = newConfig.royaltiesBps;  //@audit not checked to be <= 10000.

        if (!newConfig.tokensTransferable) {
            tokensTransferable = false;  
        }
        if (!newConfig.metadataUpdatable && metadataUpdatable) {
            metadataUpdatable = false;
            emit PermanentURIGlobal();
        }

        _updateRoles(rolesAddresses);

        if (isRevokeNFTPortPermissions) {
            revokeNFTPortPermissions();
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review, VSCode

## Recommendation

Add require statements in the `update` function:
```solidity
require(newConfig.royaltiesAddress != address(0), "Address cannot be zero");
require(newConfig.royaltiesBps <= ROYALTIES_BASIS, "royaltiesBps is too Big");
```
