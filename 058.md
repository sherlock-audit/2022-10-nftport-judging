# Signature reuse

## Summary
Data signed and used one time can be reused many times
`nonce` is not included in signed data
## Vulnerability Detail
There are two types of `deploy()` and `call()`
1st type where user pays via `msg.value` each time he calls the methods.
2nd type where signature is provided.
Such signature can be reused any times because `nonce` for each user is not included
This allows a user to call `deploy()` and `call()` again and again

```solidity
170:         signedOnly(
171:             abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, templateName, initdata),
172:             signature
173:         )

194:         signedOnly(
195:             abi.encodePacked(
196:                 msg.sender,
197:                 templateName,
198:                 templateVersion,
199:                 initdata
200:             ),
201:             signature
202:         )

222:         signedOnly(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, instance, data), signature)
```

```solidity
contracts/Factory.sol
537:     modifier signedOnly(bytes memory message, bytes calldata signature) {
538:         // Gets the address that signed the message with signature
539:         address messageSigner = ECDSA.recover(
540:             ECDSA.toEthSignedMessageHash(message),
541:             signature
542:         );
543: 
544:         require(hasRole(SIGNER_ROLE, messageSigner), "Signer not recognized");
545: 
546:         _;
547:     }
```
## Impact
Potential loss of income, because factory users can use `deploy()` and `call()` for free.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Include user's nonce in what's hashed:
 ```diff
+		  mapping(address => uint256) public nonces;

- 222:         signedOnly(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, instance, data), signature)
+ 222:         signedOnly(abi.encodePacked(nonces[msg.sender]++, msg.sender, instance, data), signature)
```
