# Compromised admin address

## Summary
The Factory contract has `withdrawFees` function for the admin to withdraw the contract balance to an EOA. However, if somehow, the admin address is compromised, this function will be utilized to flush the balance to an arbitrary address as well.
## Vulnerability Detail
It's not common to have compromised wallets in the projects but it's the aim of the actors. So the industry has infamous experiences regarding this vulnerability. Even the multisig wallets are not a solution since all the wallet admins are friends. Unless a DAO-controlled wallet is implemented and it's kind of a question mark to consider this as a vulnerability, but as stated before, we have seen this before and the addresses might be compromised.

## Impact
Loss of reputation and protocol funds
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function withdrawFees(address to) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) {
        Address.sendValue(payable(to), address(this).balance);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Implement a whitelist of addresses to withdraw the fees.
