# Should prevent users from sending more fees than required in `Factory.sol`

## Summary

If a user accidently sends more fees than required during deployment, `Factory` contract just accepts it, resulting in loss of funds for the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

Factory.sol `modifier paidOnly(uint256 fee)` will enforce a minimum payment for the function call. This modifier is used by `call` and `deploy` functions.
In the `call` function, users may need to send more `msg.value` than `callFee` and pass remaining values to `_call`.
But in the `deploy` function, it's not necessary to pass the remaining `msg.value` to `_deploy`. If a user sends `msg.value` more than `deploymentFee`, the user will lose these remaining ETH.

## Impact

Users will lose funds if more than required ETH are sent to `deploymentFee` accidentally.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When calling the `deploy` function, it should check that `msg.value == deploymentFee`:

```solidity
    function deploy(string calldata name, bytes calldata initdata)
        external
        payable
        exactPaidOnly(deploymentFee)

    modifier exactPaidOnly(uint256 fee) {
        require(msg.value == fee, "wrong payment");
        _;
    }
```
