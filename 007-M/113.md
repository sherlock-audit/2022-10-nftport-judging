# `UPDATE_CONTRACT_ROLE` users can't call `update()`. They need to be admins too.

## Summary
Someone calling `update()` for `ERC721NFTProduct` or `ERC1155NFTProduct`, who only posess the `UPDATE_CONTRACT_ROLE`, won't be able to update the contract, as a check is made further down that the caller also has the `ADMIN_ROLE`. This role is therefore useless / badly implemented.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `ERC721NFTProduct` and `ERC1155NFTProduct`, there's a separation of concern for the `UPDATE_CONTRACT_ROLE` and `ADMIN_ROLE`, meaning it's not expected that all `UPDATE_CONTRACT_ROLE` are admins. However, those with only the `UPDATE_CONTRACT_ROLE` can't do anything besides calling `ERC1155NFTProduct.setURI()`.

As the public `update` functions have the `onlyRole(UPDATE_CONTRACT_ROLE)` modifier, it can be expected from them to actually be able to call the functions, however it reverts further down if called by them, due to the `hasRole(ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender)` check. The oddest part is that this revert seems to be expected in the unit tests:

```solidity
File: ERC721NFTProduct.test.js
1114:       it("Should fail when called by an updater", async () => {
1115:         await expect(
1116:           contract.connect(updater).update(runtimeDefaults, testRoles, false)
1117:         ).to.be.revertedWith("GranularRoles: not an admin");
1118:       });
```

Why then even use `onlyRole(UPDATE_CONTRACT_ROLE)` instead of `onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE)`?

## Impact
Useless / badly implemented role `UPDATE_CONTRACT_ROLE` .

## Code Snippet
`update` functions with the `onlyRole(UPDATE_CONTRACT_ROLE)` modifier until calls to `function _updateRoles() internal`:

`function _updateRoles() internal` checking for `ADMIN_ROLE`:

Only current use-case for someone with only `UPDATE_CONTRACT_ROLE`:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an if statement for `hasRole(ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender)` before the calls to `_updateRoles` if this is the only thing someone who's only `UPDATE_CONTRACT_ROLE` can do.
Or change `onlyRole(UPDATE_CONTRACT_ROLE)` with `onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE)` if `UPDATE_CONTRACT_ROLE` is useless.
Correct the unit tests accordingly.
