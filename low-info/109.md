## Summary
`paidOnly() && paymentProvided()` are both modifiers check if enough `msg.value` was sent to pay for the `fee` to deploy and `payment` to mint. 

## Vulnerability Detail
If a user where to accidentally send exta `msg.value` it's not reaturned to back to the user and is instead given to the contacts themselves.

## Impact
Both modifiers allow `msg.value > premium` and don't send back excess `msg.value` causing them to be paid to the contracts
