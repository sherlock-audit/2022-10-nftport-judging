# Two-step change of privileged roles

## Summary

Lack of two-step procedure for critical operations is error-prone and can lead to irrevocable mistakes, might leave the system operationally with no/malicious privileged role. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Currently single-step change is used for ownership transfer.


## Impact

When transfer ownership, in a single-step change, if the current admin accidentally changes the new admin to a zero-address or an incorrect address (where the private keys are not available), the system is left without an operational admin and will have to be redeployed. 

However, a two-step process is similar to the approve-transferFrom functionality: The contract approves the new address for a new role, and the new address acquires the role by calling the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When privileged roles are being changed, it is recommended to follow a two-step approach: 
1. The current privileged role proposes a new address for the change.
2. The newly proposed address then claims the privileged role in a separate transaction.
