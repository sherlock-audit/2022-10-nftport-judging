# `initialize` does not check `runtimeConfig.royaltiesBps`, which can break the royalty functionality

## Summary
initialize does not check runtimeConfig.royaltiesBps, which can break the royalty functionality

## Vulnerability Detail
`NFTCollection` is used as a template contract for proxies to delegate their logic to. It is to be initialized using `initialize()`, which takes two arguments `deploymentConfig` and `runtimeConfig`, that will set configurations of the collection.

The issue is that will the function validates `deploymentConfig` by calling `_validateDeploymentConfig`, it does not perform any check on `runtimeConfig`, meaning `royaltiesBps` can be set to higher than 100% (`10000`)

Note that the same issue is present in `ERC721NFTProduct` and `ERC1155NFTProduct`

## Impact
If `runtimeConfig.royaltiesBps` is set to higher `10000`, the `royaltyAmount` [returned](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/templates/NFTCollection.sol#L481-L483) in `royaltyInfo()` will be greater than `salePrice`.
It means any marketplace implementing `EIP2981` trying to sell a NFT of this collection would lead to the sell function call reverting at best, or if not implementing enough validation, leading to the buyer or marketplace losing funds, as the `royaltyAmount` transferred will be greater than the expected `salePrice`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
While initialize does not need to call `_validateRuntimeConfig`, it should at least check `runtimeConfig.royaltiesBps`:

```diff
141:     function initialize(
142:         DeploymentConfig memory deploymentConfig,
143:         RuntimeConfig memory runtimeConfig
144:     ) public initializer {
145:         _validateDeploymentConfig(deploymentConfig);
+            require(runtimeConfig.royaltiesBps <= ROYALTIES_BASIS, "Royalties too high");
```
