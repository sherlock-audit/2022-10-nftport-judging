# Use `private` rather than `public constants`

## Summary

Use `private` rather than `public constants`

## Vulnerability Detail

Using `private` rather than `public` for `constants`, saves gas

## Impact
Gas usage

```js
File: contracts/Factory.sol

32: uint256 public constant CODE_VERSION = 1_01_00;

35: bytes32 public constant ADMIN_ROLE = keccak256("ADMIN_ROLE");

37: bytes32 public constant SIGNER_ROLE = keccak256("SIGNER_ROLE");
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that returns a tuple of the values of all currently-public constants. Saves 3406-3606 gas in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where itâ€™s used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table
