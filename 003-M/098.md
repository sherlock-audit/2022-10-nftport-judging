# NFTCollection: No limit on royaltiesBps

## Summary
NFTCollection does not limit changes to royaltiesBps
## Vulnerability Detail
In the NFTCollection contract, no flag like royaltiesBpsUpdatable is used to limit changes to royaltiesBps.
This results in royaltiesBps being able to be changed at any time and up to 100% of the sale price, which is likely to frontrun the user's NFT purchase process and thus the NFT seller suffers a loss.
## Impact
It is likely to frontrun the user's NFT purchase process and thus the NFT seller suffers a loss.
