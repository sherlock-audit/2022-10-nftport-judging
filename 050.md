# Admin Could accidentally transfer his role to zero-address

## Summary

There is no protection against admin rights to be transferred to a zero-address, which results in permanent loss of admin rights.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `NFTCollection.sol`, there is a function called [transferAdminRights](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/templates/NFTCollection.sol#L255-L261), which transfers the `ADMIN_ROLE` to the input argument address `to`. 

The function never checks if the address `to` is zero or not. And if the current admin accidentally calls this function with zero-address the `ADMIN_ROLE` will be permanently lost. 

The POC was written to make sure that the function doesnt revert if the input address `to` = `0x0`.

## Impact

Permanent loss of `ADMIN_ROLE`.

## Code Snippet

```js
    it("Zero Address transfer should fail", async () => {
      const { deployer, external } = await signers();
      await expect(
        collection.connect(deployer).transferAdminRights(ethers.constants.AddressZero)
      ).to.be.revertedWith();
    }); 
```

## Tool used

Manual Review, Hardhat

## Recommendation

Use a require statement with zero-address check as shown below in the `transferAdminRights` function:
```solidity
require(to != address(0), "INVALID_ADDRESS");
```
