# Lack of `runtimeConfig.presaleMintStart`, `runtimeConfig.publicMintStart` validation can lead to presale whitelisted users not able to mint

## Vulnerability Detail
`NFTCollection` is used as a template contract for proxies to delegate their logic to. It is to be initialized using `initialize()`, which takes two arguments `deploymentConfig` and `runtimeConfig`, that will set configurations of the collection, including public and pre-sale minting times using `publicMintStart` and `presaleMintStart`.

While it is said that:
```solidity
//both public and presale minting can be active at the same time
```
And indeed looking at `mintingActive()` and `presaleActive()`: once the pre-sale is active, they cannot be made inactive, meaning both pre- and public sales will be active at the same time eventually.

The issue is that there is no validation, neither in `initialize()` nor in `updateConfig()`, to ensure `runtimeConfig.presaleMintStart < runtimeConfig.publicMintStart`, meaning a public sale can start before the whitelist pre-sale.

## Impact
Depending on the activity/collection hype, this can mean all the tokens available for minting (ie `availableSupply()`) could be minted in the public sale before the whitelist pre-sale starts, effectively grieving the whitelisted users.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using a buffer period between the start of the pre-sale and the start of the public sale (to leave time for whitelisted users to mint), and validating accordingly in `initialize` and `updateConfig`:

```diff
141:     function initialize(
142:         DeploymentConfig memory deploymentConfig,
143:         RuntimeConfig memory runtimeConfig
144:     ) public initializer {
145:         _validateDeploymentConfig(deploymentConfig);
+            require(runtimeConfig.presaleMintStart + BUFFER <= runtimeConfig.publicMintStart, "public sale starting too early");
```

```diff
289:     function updateConfig(RuntimeConfig calldata newConfig)
290:         external
291:         onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE)
292:     {
293:         _validateRuntimeConfig(newConfig);
+            require(newConfig.presaleMintStart + BUFFER <= newConfig.publicMintStart, "public sale starting too early");
294:         _runtimeConfig = newConfig;
295:     }
```
