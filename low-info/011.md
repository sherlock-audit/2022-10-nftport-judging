# An owner can set fees before a user tx has executed and the tx will be reverted

## Summary
* An owner can set fees before a user tx has executed and the tx will be reverted 
## Vulnerability Detail
alice makes tx with `msg.value=1ether` which is the fee/nft
owner frontruns this tx and makes `fee=2 ether` or the nft and then when alice tx is executing it gets reverted 
## Impact
dos 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function setDeploymentFee(uint256 newFee) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) {
        deploymentFee = newFee;
    }
```
```solidity 
    function updateConfig(RuntimeConfig calldata newConfig)
        external
        onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE)
    {
        _validateRuntimeConfig(newConfig);
        _runtimeConfig = newConfig;
