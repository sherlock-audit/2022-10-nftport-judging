# Operator can change own role bypassing require

## Summary

A require check exists on line 238 to prevent an operator changing their own role. This check can be bypassed using a second address that is an operator, which can be owned by the first operator, making this check useless.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue is in this line of code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport/blob/main/evm-minting-master/contracts/Factory.sol#L238

An operator can call `setOperator` to grant or revoke the contract operator role from an address. There is a require check to prevent an operator from changing their own role. But this require check can be bypassed. If Alice is an operator, Alice can assign operator status to another account owned by Alice, say account Alvin. After the Alvin account has operator status, this operator account can call `setOperator` to modify the operator status of Alice. If the point of this check is to avoid a situation where no operator is assigned, this can be bypassed too. The Alvin address could be a smart contract with a `selfdestruct` call, so a scenario could be reached where no operator is assigned. In summary, this require check does not serve its intended purpose and provides a false sense of security.

## Impact

The require check on line 238 can be bypassed and provides a false sense of security. Operators can modify their own roles and edge cases related to this scenario could lead to a denial of service situation if the operators and/or admins are
